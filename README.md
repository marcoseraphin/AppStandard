## Changelog

**2nd February 2020**

Apart from updating NuGet packages there is a new FreshMasterDetailNavigationContainer which is based upon it but has the possibility to add a AppStandardNavMenuItem with not only a page name but also an icon. There is also a little workaround to deselect a clicked item automatically instead keeping the ugly orange backgrounded item selected.
